# NaNoRenO 2023 - Leilani and the White Lily

This was our entry into the NaNoRenO 2023 gamejam. I worked with a small team consisting of myself as the programmer, an artist, a story writer and a composer.

I had the following goals for this project
- Making a visual novel with multiple endings in Unity from the ground up.
- Working on editor tooling to make it easier to create chapters and branching paths.
- Learning Unity's UIToolkit system.

I successfully managed to pick up these new skills and achieved my goals.
